        When I graduated college, I still had a huge, lingering question: what
        is the point? I didn't mean it in a way like I didn't think there was
        one. I just didn't know what it was, for me.

        One of my favorite courses in college had a lesson on purpose that
        resonated with me deeply. What I took from it was this: any purpose I
        believe I have is chosen by me. I could choose that my purpose is to
        spread an idea, or to build something great, or to, by any, make the
        world a better place.

        I found many purposes to be worthwhile, but I wanted something concise,
        something like a personal mission statement. There were so many things I
        wanted to improve, so many things I wanted to fix. What was the value
        they all shared?
