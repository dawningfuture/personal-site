        When I work on a project, I am passionate about it. It is important to
        me that the projects I work on pursue my mission: whatever I work on, I
        want it to create joy. The projects I've recently created have brought
        me a lot of joy, and I hope, others as well.

        Below, I'm going to nerd out about my recent projects that I'm most
        proud of. I love talking about them; if you would like to know more
        about them, or think we might be able to connect around another project,
        please use the
        <a class="body-link" [routerLink]="['/connect']">Connect page</a> and
        reach out to me.
